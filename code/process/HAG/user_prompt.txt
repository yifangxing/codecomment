Below is some information gathered from our code  repository.
To help you understand the method in context, we provide the following:
1.Class functionality:
Described the main functions and responsibilities of the current method's class
{{domain}}
2.Callee methods with documentation:
A list of methods called within the target method. Each is paired with its corresponding comment.
Format: calleeName: comment
{{callees_docstrings}}
3.Importance score for each callee:
Each callee has an importance score, indicating how critical it is for understanding the functionality of the calling method.
A higher score means the callee contributes more significantly to the semantics of the caller.
Format: calleeName: score
{{score}}
