1 Returns the result of calling {@link CacheLoader#loadAll}, or null if {@code loader} doesn't implement {@code loadAll}.
2 Finds the next entry in the current chain. Returns true if an entry was found.
3 Returns a newly-created immutable table. <p>Prefer the equivalent method {@link #buildOrThrow()} to make it explicit that the method will throw an exception if there are duplicate key pairs. The {@code build()} method will soon be deprecated. @throws IllegalArgumentException if duplicate key pairs were added
