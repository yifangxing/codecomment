1 Returns an immutable copy of the provided table. <p>The {@link Table#cellSet()} iteration order of the provided table determines the iteration ordering of all views in the returned table. Note that some views of the original table and the copied table may have different iteration orders. For more control over the ordering, create a {@link Builder} and call {@link Builder#orderRowsBy}, {@link Builder#orderColumnsBy}, and {@link Builder#putAll} <p>Despite the method name, this method attempts to avoid actually copying the data when it is safe to do so. The exact circumstances under which a copy will or will not be performed are undocumented and subject to change.
2 Returns a {@code Collector} that accumulates elements into an {@code ImmutableTable}. Each input element is mapped to one cell in the returned table, with the rows, columns, and values generated by applying the specified functions. <p>The returned {@code Collector} will throw a {@code NullPointerException} at collection time if the row, column, or value functions return null on any input. @since 21.0
