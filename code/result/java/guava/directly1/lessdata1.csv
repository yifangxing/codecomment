   *
   * <p>{@code forTree()} is especially useful (versus {@code forGraph()}) in cases where the data
   * structure being traversed is, in addition to being a tree/forest, also defined <a
   * href=""https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#non-recursiveness"">recursively</a>.
   * This is because the {@code forTree()}-based implementations don't keep track of visited nodes,

   *   <li>Traversals require <i>O(n)</i> time (where <i>n</i> is the number of nodes reachable from

   *   <li>While traversing, the traverser will use <i>O(H)</i> space (where <i>H</i> is the number
   *       of nodes that have been seen but not yet visited, that is, the ""horizon"").
   * </ul>

   * <p><b>Examples</b> (all edges are directed facing downwards)

   * <p>The graph below would be valid input with start nodes of {@code a, f, c}. However, if {@code

*/","* Creates a table that uses the specified backing map and factory. It can generate a table based
   * on arbitrary {@link Map} classes.
   *
   * <p>The {@code factory}-generated and {@code backingMap} classes determine the table iteration
   * order. However, the table's {@code row()} method returns instances of a different class than
   * {@code factory.get()} does.
   *
   * <p>Call this method only when the simpler factory methods in classes like {@link
   * HashBasedTable} and {@link TreeBasedTable} won't suffice.
   *
   * <p>The views returned by the {@code Table} methods {@link Table#column}, {@link
   * Table#columnKeySet}, and {@link Table#columnMap} have iterators that don't support {@code
   * remove()}. Otherwise, all optional operations are supported. Null row keys, columns keys, and
   * values are not supported.
   *
   * <p>Lookups by row key are often faster than lookups by column key, because the data is stored
   * in a {@code Map<R, Map<C, V>>}. A method call like {@code column(columnKey).get(rowKey)} still
   * runs quickly, since the row key is provided. However, {@code column(columnKey).size()} takes
   * longer, since an iteration across all row keys occurs.
   *
   * <p>Note that this implementation is not synchronized. If multiple threads access this table
   * concurrently and one of the threads modifies the table, it must be synchronized externally.
   *
   * <p>The table is serializable if {@code backingMap}, {@code factory}, the maps generated by
   * {@code factory}, and the table contents are all serializable.
   *
   * <p>Note: the table assumes complete ownership over of {@code backingMap} and the maps returned
   * by {@code factory}. Those objects should not be manually updated and they should not use soft,
   * weak, or phantom references.

   * <p>The returned set isn't threadsafe or serializable, even if {@code unfiltered} is.
   *
   * <p>Many of the filtered set's methods, such as {@code size()}, iterate across every element in
   * the underlying set and determine which elements satisfy the filter. When a live view is
   * <i>not</i> needed, it may be faster to copy {@code Iterables.filter(unfiltered, predicate)} and
   * use the copy.
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> {@code predicate} must be <i>consistent with equals</i>, as documented at
   * {@link Predicate#apply}. Do not provide a predicate such as {@code
   * Predicates.instanceOf(ArrayList.class)}, which is inconsistent with equals. (See {@link

 */","* Returns the result of {@link Future#get(long, TimeUnit)}, converting most exceptions to a new
   * instance of the given checked exception type. This reduces boilerplate for a common use of
   * {@code Future} in which it is unnecessary to programmatically distinguish between exception
   * types or to extract other information from the exception instance.
   *
   * <p>Exceptions from {@code Future.get} are treated as follows:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Any {@link ExecutionException} has its <i>cause</i> wrapped in an {@code X} if the cause
   *       is a checked exception, an {@link UncheckedExecutionException} if the cause is a {@code
   *       RuntimeException}, or an {@link ExecutionError} if the cause is an {@code Error}.
   *   <li>Any {@link InterruptedException} is wrapped in an {@code X} (after restoring the
   *       interrupt).
   *   <li>Any {@link TimeoutException} is wrapped in an {@code X}.
   *   <li>Any {@link CancellationException} is propagated untouched, as is any other {@link
   *       RuntimeException} (though {@code get} implementations are discouraged from throwing such
   *       exceptions).
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>The overall principle is to continue to treat every checked exception as a checked
   * exception, every unchecked exception as an unchecked exception, and every error as an error. In
   * addition, the cause of any {@code ExecutionException} is wrapped in order to ensure that the
   * new stack trace matches that of the current thread.
   *
   * <p>Instances of {@code exceptionClass} are created by choosing an arbitrary public constructor
   * that accepts zero or more arguments, all of type {@code String} or {@code Throwable}
   * (preferring constructors with at least one {@code String}) and calling the constructor via
   * reflection. If the exception did not already have a cause, one is set by calling {@link
   * Throwable#initCause(Throwable)} on it. If no such constructor exists, an {@code
   * IllegalArgumentException} is thrown.
   *
   * @throws X if {@code get} throws any checked exception except for an {@code ExecutionException}
   *     whose cause is not itself a checked exception
   * @throws UncheckedExecutionException if {@code get} throws an {@code ExecutionException} with a
