   * <p>This method is significantly faster than {@link String#equalsIgnoreCase} and should be used
   * in preference if at least one of the parameters is known to contain only ASCII characters.
   *
   * <p>Note however that this method does not always behave identically to expressions such as:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@code string.toUpperCase().equals(""UPPER CASE ASCII"")}
   *   <li>{@code string.toLowerCase().equals(""lower case ascii"")}
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>due to case-folding of some non-ASCII characters (which does not occur in {@link
   * String#equalsIgnoreCase}). However in almost all cases that ASCII strings are used, the author
   * probably wanted the behavior provided by this method rather than the subtle and sometimes
   * surprising behavior of {@code toUpperCase()} and {@code toLowerCase()}.

   *
   * <p>{@code forTree()} is especially useful (versus {@code forGraph()}) in cases where the data

   * href=""https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#non-recursiveness"">recursively</a>.
   * This is because the {@code forTree()}-based implementations don't keep track of visited nodes,

   *   <li>Traversals require <i>O(n)</i> time (where <i>n</i> is the number of nodes reachable from

   *   <li>While traversing, the traverser will use <i>O(H)</i> space (where <i>H</i> is the number
   *       of nodes that have been seen but not yet visited, that is, the ""horizon"").
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>Examples</b> (all edges are directed facing downwards)
   *
   * <p>The graph below would be valid input with start nodes of {@code a, f, c}. However, if {@code
   * b} were <i>also</i> a start node, then there would be multiple paths to reach {@code e} and

","* Creates a table that uses the specified backing map and factory. It can generate a table based
   * on arbitrary {@link Map} classes.
   *
   * <p>The {@code factory}-generated and {@code backingMap} classes determine the table iteration
   * order. However, the table's {@code row()} method returns instances of a different class than
   * {@code factory.get()} does.
   *
   * <p>Call this method only when the simpler factory methods in classes like {@link
   * HashBasedTable} and {@link TreeBasedTable} won't suffice.
   *
   * <p>The views returned by the {@code Table} methods {@link Table#column}, {@link
   * Table#columnKeySet}, and {@link Table#columnMap} have iterators that don't support {@code
   * remove()}. Otherwise, all optional operations are supported. Null row keys, columns keys, and
   * values are not supported.
   *
   * <p>Lookups by row key are often faster than lookups by column key, because the data is stored
   * in a {@code Map<R, Map<C, V>>}. A method call like {@code column(columnKey).get(rowKey)} still
   * runs quickly, since the row key is provided. However, {@code column(columnKey).size()} takes
   * longer, since an iteration across all row keys occurs.
   *
   * <p>Note that this implementation is not synchronized. If multiple threads access this table
   * concurrently and one of the threads modifies the table, it must be synchronized externally.
   *
   * <p>The table is serializable if {@code backingMap}, {@code factory}, the maps generated by
   * {@code factory}, and the table contents are all serializable.
   *
   * <p>Note: the table assumes complete ownership over of {@code backingMap} and the maps returned
   * by {@code factory}. Those objects should not be manually updated and they should not use soft,
   * weak, or phantom references.

   * is. The {@code equals} and {@code hashCode} methods of the returned multimap are meaningless,
   * since there is not a definition of {@code equals} or {@code hashCode} for general collections,
   * and {@code get()} will return a general {@code Collection} as opposed to a {@code List} or a
   * {@code Set}.
   *
   * <p>The transformer is applied lazily, invoked when needed. This is necessary for the returned
   * multimap to be a view, but it means that the transformer will be applied many times for bulk
   * operations like {@link Multimap#containsValue} and {@link Object#toString}. For this to perform

   * doesn't need to be a view, copy the returned multimap into a new multimap of your choosing.

","* Assigns to {@code hashCode} a ""bucket"" in the range {@code [0, buckets)}, in a uniform manner
   * that minimizes the need for remapping as {@code buckets} grows. That is, {@code
   * consistentHash(h, n)} equals:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@code n - 1}, with approximate probability {@code 1/n}
   *   <li>{@code consistentHash(h, n - 1)}, otherwise (probability {@code 1 - 1/n})
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>This method is suitable for the common use case of dividing work among buckets that meet the
   * following conditions:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>You want to assign the same fraction of inputs to each bucket.
   *   <li>When you reduce the number of buckets, you can accept that the most recently added
   *       buckets will be removed first. More concretely, if you are dividing traffic among tasks,
   *       you can decrease the number of tasks from 15 and 10, killing off the final 5 tasks, and
   *       {@code consistentHash} will handle it. If, however, you are dividing traffic among
   *       servers {@code alpha}, {@code bravo}, and {@code charlie} and you occasionally need to
   *       take each of the servers offline, {@code consistentHash} will be a poor fit: It provides
   *       no way for you to specify which of the three buckets is disappearing. Thus, if your
   *       buckets change from {@code [alpha, bravo, charlie]} to {@code [bravo, charlie]}, it will
   *       assign all the old {@code alpha} traffic to {@code bravo} and all the old {@code bravo}
   *       traffic to {@code charlie}, rather than letting {@code bravo} keep its traffic.

   *       {@link #withoutCloser(AsyncFunction)}
