770 Save the PDF as an incremental update. This is only possible if the PDF was loaded from a file or a stream, not if the document was created in PDFBox itself. There must be a path of objects that have {@link COSUpdateInfo#isNeedToBeUpdated()} set, starting from the document catalog. For signatures this is taken care by PDFBox itself. <p> Other usages of this method are for experienced users only. You will usually never need it. It is useful only if you are required to keep the current revision and append the changes. A typical use case is changing a signed file without invalidating the signature. <p> If your modification includes annotations, make sure these link back to their page by calling {@link PDAnnotation#setPage(PDPage)}. Although this is optional, not doing it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74836898/">can cause trouble when PDFs get signed</a>. (PDFBox already does this for signature widget annotations) <p> Another problem with page-based modifications can occur if the page tree isn't flat: there won't be an closed update path from the catalog to the page. To fix this, add code like this: <pre>{@code COSDictionary parent = page.getCOSObject().getCOSDictionary(COSName.PARENT); while (parent != null) { parent.setNeedToBeUpdated(true); parent = parent.getCOSDictionary(COSName.PARENT); } }</pre> Don't use the input file as target as this will produce a corrupted file. @param output stream to write to.

982 Create a PDImageXObject from an image file. The file format is determined by the file content. The following file types are supported: JPG, JPEG, TIF, TIFF, GIF, BMP and PNG.

(The later can also be used to create a PDImageXObject from a BufferedImage). Starting with 2.0.18, this call will create an image directly from a PNG file without decoding it (when possible), which is faster. However the result size depends on the compression skill of the software that created the PNG file. If file size or bandwidth are important to you or to your clients, then create your PNG files with a tool that has implemented the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/zopfli-optimization-literally-free-bandwidth/">Zopfli algorithm</a>, or use the two-step process mentioned above. @param file the image file. @param doc the document that shall use this PDImageXObject. @return a PDImageXObject. @throws IOException if there is an error when reading the file or creating the PDImageXObject. @throws IllegalArgumentException if the image type is not supported.

1062 Add parameters of signature to be created externally using default signature options. See {@link #saveIncrementalForExternalSigning(OutputStream)} method description on external signature creation scenario details. <p> Only one signature may be added in a document. To sign several times, load document, add signature, save incremental and close again. @param sigObject is the PDSignatureField model @throws IOException if there is an error creating required fields @throws IllegalStateException if one attempts to add several signature fields.
1063 Creates a new PDFont instance with the appropriate subclass. @param dictionary a font dictionary @return a PDFont instance, based on the SubType entry of the dictionary @throws IOException if something goes wrong
1064 Returns the font resource with the given name, or null if none exists. @param name Name of the font resource. @return the font with the given name or null @throws IOException if something went wrong.
1065 Fills and then strokes the path. @param windingRule The winding rule this path will use. @throws IOException If there is an IO error while filling the path.
1066 This will save this document to the filesystem. @param fileName The file to save as. @throws IOException If there is an error saving the document.
1067 This will flatten all form fields. <p> Flattening a form field will take the current appearance and make that part of the pages content stream. All form fields and annotations associated are removed. </p> <p> Invisible and hidden fields will be skipped and will not become part of the page content stream </p> <p> The appearances for the form fields widgets will <strong>not</strong> be generated </p> @throws IOException if something went wrong flattening the fields
1068 Copies any needed resources from the document’s DR dictionary into the stream’s Resources dictionary. Resources with the same name shall be left intact.
1069 append all pages from source to destination. @param destination the document to receive the pages @param source the document originating the new pages @throws IOException If there is an error accessing data from either document.
1070 Try to convert a PNG into a PDImageXObject. If for any reason the PNG can not be converted, null is returned. <p> This usually means the PNG structure is damaged (CRC error, etc.) or it uses some features which can not be mapped to PDF. @param doc the document to put the image in @param imageData the byte data of the PNG @return null or the PDImageXObject built from the png
1071 This will get the font for this font setting. @return The font for this setting of null if one was not found. @throws IOException If there is an error getting the font.
1072 Constructs and sets new contents for given appearance stream.
1073 Create a PDImageXObject from an image byte array. This overloaded version allows providing a custom factory to handle specific image formats, such as BMP and GIF, or to act as a fallback strategy when the default converters (e.g., for PNG or TIFF) fail. @param document the document that shall use this PDImageXObject. @param byteArray bytes from an image file. @param name name of image file for exception messages, can be null. @param customFactory optional factory used to handle BMP, GIF, or fallback cases (e.g., for PNG or TIFF). If {@code null}, this method delegates to {@link #createFromByteArray(PDDocument, byte[], String)}. @return a PDImageXObject. @throws IOException if there is an error when reading the file or creating the PDImageXObject. @throws IllegalArgumentException if the image type is not supported.
1074 This will implement the gs operator. @param gs The state to copy this dictionaries values into. @throws IOException If there is an error copying font information.
1075 Processes the operators of the given content stream. @param content the content to parse. @throws IOException if there is an error reading or parsing the content stream.
1076 Create a PDImageXObject from bytes of an image file. The file format is determined by the file content. The following file types are supported: JPG, JPEG, TIF, TIFF, GIF, BMP and PNG. This is a convenience method that calls {@link JPEGFactory#createFromByteArray}, {@link CCITTFactory#createFromFile} or {@link ImageIO#read} combined with {@link LosslessFactory#createFromImage}. (The later can also be used to create a PDImageXObject from a BufferedImage). Starting with 2.0.18, this call will create an image directly from a PNG file without decoding it (when possible), which is faster. However the result size depends on the compression skill of the software that created the PNG file. If file size or bandwidth are important to you or to your clients, then create your PNG files with a tool that has implemented the <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/zopfli-optimization-literally-free-bandwidth/">Zopfli algorithm</a>, or use the two-step process mentioned above. @param byteArray bytes from an image file. @param document the document that shall use this PDImageXObject. @param name name of image file for exception messages, can be null. @return a PDImageXObject. @throws IOException if there is an error when reading the file or creating the PDImageXObject. @throws IllegalArgumentException if the image type is not supported.
1077 Constructor for reading an existing DA string. @param defaultResources DR entry @param defaultAppearance DA entry @throws IOException If the DA could not be parsed
1078 Get the default appearance. This is an inheritable attribute. The default appearance contains a set of default graphics and text operators to define the field’s text size and color. @return the DA element of the dictionary object
1079 This is the public method for setting the appearance stream. @param apValue the String value which the appearance should represent @throws IOException If there is an error creating the stream.
1080 Constructs a COSAppearance from the given field. @param field the field which you wish to control the appearance of @throws IOException
