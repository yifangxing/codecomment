Providing null as the value will remove the local default appearance. <p> This method can also be used to change the font of a field, by replacing the font name from this string with another font name found in the AcroForm default resources <u>before</u> calling {@link #setValue(java.lang.String) setValue(String)}, see also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47995062/pdfbox-api-how-to-handle-cyrillic-values">this stackoverflow answer</a>. For example, "/Helv 10 Tf 0 g" can be replaced with "/F1 10 Tf 0 g". Performance may go down (see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-4508">PDFBOX-4508)</a> if this is done for many fields and with a very large font (e.g. ArialUni); to avoid this, save and reload the file after changing all fields. @param daValue a string describing the default appearance

1607 This will set the CYX factor. @param cyx CYX factor
1608 This will read a COSStream from the input stream using length attribute within dictionary. If length attribute is a indirect reference it is first resolved to get the stream length. This means we copy stream data without testing for 'endstream' or 'endobj' and thus it is no problem if these keywords occur within stream. We require 'endstream' to be found after stream data is read. @param dic dictionary that goes with this stream. @return parsed pdf stream. @throws IOException if an error occurred reading the stream, like problems with reading length attribute, stream does not end with 'endstream' after data read, stream too short etc.

1611 Processes the operators of the given content stream. @param contentStream to content stream to parse. @throws IOException if there is an error reading or parsing the content stream.
1612 This will parse all the tokens in the stream. This will close the stream when it is finished parsing. @return All of the tokens in the stream. @throws IOException If there is an error while parsing the stream.
1613 Calculate the bounding box of this glyph. This will work only if the first operator in the stream is d1. @return the bounding box of this glyph, or null if the first operator is not d1. @throws IOException If an io error occurs while parsing the stream.
1614 Get the width from a type3 charproc stream. @return the glyph width. @throws IOException if the stream could not be read, or did not have d0 or d1 as first operator, or if their first argument was not a number.
1615 This will write the pdf document. If signature should be created externally, {@link #writeExternalSignature(byte[])} should be invoked to set signature after calling this method. @param doc The document to write. @throws IOException If an error occurs while generating the data.
1616 Save the PDF as an incremental update. This is only possible if the PDF was loaded from a file or a stream, not if the document was created in PDFBox itself. There must be a path of objects that have {@link COSUpdateInfo#isNeedToBeUpdated()} set, starting from the document catalog. For signatures this is taken care by PDFBox itself. <p> Other usages of this method are for experienced users only. You will usually never need it. It is useful only if you are required to keep the current revision and append the changes. A typical use case is changing a signed file without invalidating the signature. <p> If your modification includes annotations, make sure these link back to their page by calling {@link PDAnnotation#setPage(PDPage)}. Although this is optional, not doing it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74836898/">can cause trouble when PDFs get signed</a>. (PDFBox already does this for signature widget annotations) <p> Another problem with page-based modifications can occur if the page tree isn't flat: there won't be an closed update path from the catalog to the page. To fix this, add code like this: <pre>{@code COSDictionary parent = page.getCOSObject().getCOSDictionary(COSName.PARENT); while (parent != null) { parent.setNeedToBeUpdated(true); parent = parent.getCOSDictionary(COSName.PARENT); } }</pre> Don't use the input file as target as this will produce a corrupted file. @param output stream to write to. It will be closed when done. It <i><b>must never</b></i> point to the source file or that one will be harmed! @throws IOException if the output could not be written @throws IllegalStateException if the document was not loaded from a file or a stream.
1617 Save the PDF as an incremental update. This is only possible if the PDF was loaded from a file or a stream, not if the document was created in PDFBox itself. This allows to include objects even if there is no path of objects that have {@link COSUpdateInfo#isNeedToBeUpdated()} set so the incremental update gets smaller. Only dictionaries are supported; if you need to update other objects classes, then add their parent dictionary. <p> This method is for experienced users only. You will usually never need it. It is useful only if you are required to keep the current revision and append the changes. A typical use case is changing a signed file without invalidating the signature. To know which objects are getting changed, you need to have some understanding of the PDF specification, and look at the saved file with an editor to verify that you are updating the correct objects. You should also inspect the page and document structures of the file with PDFDebugger. <p> If your modification includes annotations, make sure these link back to their page by calling {@link PDAnnotation#setPage(PDPage)}. Although this is optional, not doing it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74836898/">can cause trouble when PDFs get signed</a>. (PDFBox already does this for signature widget annotations) <p> Don't use the input file as target as this will produce a corrupted file. @param output stream to write to. It will be closed when done. It <i><b>must never</b></i> point to the source file or that one will be harmed! @param objectsToWrite objects that <b>must</b> be part of the incremental saving. @throws IOException if the output could not be written @throws IllegalStateException if the document was not loaded from a file or a stream.

The array consists of at least three numbers defining the horizontal corner radius, vertical corner radius, and border width. The array may have a fourth element, an optional dash array defining a pattern of dashes and gaps that shall be used in drawing the border.
